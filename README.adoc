This adds graphframes support and the Neo4j Driver to the pyspark-notebook container.

It's quite hacky because all the clean ways I tried totally didn't work.

You can grab it from Docker Hub - https://cloud.docker.com/u/markhneedham/repository/docker/markhneedham/pyspark-graphframes-neo4j-notebook
